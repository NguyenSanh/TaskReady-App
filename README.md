# Inspiration for TaskReady
You want to make sure you keep your tasks in an organized format, so I have gone ahead and helped you access an app that can do just that.

# Preconditions
- Install Angular on your system
- run **ng serve** for frontend 
- run **npm run server** for backend 

# How To Use
Use the add button to add a task name, date, and reminder toggle.

# Next Steps
I am currently working on revamping the app's designs and adding more features.
